This isn't a story you hear every day. I grew up an avid participant in the performing arts: acting, playing instruments, singing, dancing — you name it. But at the same time, since I was a child, I have been endlessly fascinated by technology. And I was constantly using it to create things — at the time, it was mostly silly videos and buggy computer games.

After seeing me flourish on the stage of the local community theater, my friends and family might think that it's "such as waste" that I'm now a software engineer (arguably one of the furthest jobs from the performing arts). But actually, the skills I learned in the theater, and the person it has transformed me into, have served me incredibly well in my career as an engineer. I would even argue that those "theater kids" are the exact type of people the software industry _desperately needs_.

This goes without saying, but community theater obviously taught me nothing about data structures, algorithms, system architecture, or the other technical skills most assume make you a good software engineer. You _do_ need all of those skills to be a good software engineer. Those are the things we learn in our CS degrees. But just knowing _computer science_ does _not_ necessarily make you a good software engineer in the real world.

What we traditionally think of as "hard" skills mean nothing without "soft" skills. From a job-seeker and job-doer's perspective, it doesn't matter how well you know he ins and out of Rust or how quickly you can spin up resilient Kubernetes cluster if you can't communicate with non-technical stakeholders (aka the people hiring you) or if you can't empathize with with your fellow engineer teammates to design a system maintainable by a group.

## Confidence and Courage

## Being able to focus on the same task for obscene amounts of time

### Sort term - writing code all day / memorizing lines

I still remember the late nights sitting at the kitchen counter with my "Elf the Musical" script, memorizing every word Buddy the Elf had ever said.

### Long term - sticking with a project / rehearsing the same show for months

## A love for public speaking

## "You can talk to people normally"

After telling her I was writing this article, my wife jokingly declared _"you can talk to people normally."_ And yes, yes I can! Obviously not every software engineer has the communication skills of a cardboard box, but the stereotype exists for a reason.

Some "technical" people are brilliant when it comes to writing code, but as soon as you put them in front of another person, everything goes to shit. The problem is, in the "real world," **the ability to effectively communicate with non-technical stakeholders (and also your fellow engineer teammates) has become even more important than being an expert in a certain technology.**

Searching for new jobs, asking for what you're worth

Don't get me wrong — many software engineers are very well compensated for their work, as they should be. But, many software engineers, in general, are in a prime position to be taken advantage of in the workforce. Their work is _extremely_ valuable to businesses. But due to the more reserved nature of many software engineers, they may not have the desire or courage to take the risk of putting youself
