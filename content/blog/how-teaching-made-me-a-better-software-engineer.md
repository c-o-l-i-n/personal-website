I've been writing software for a long time. Only a few years in a professional setting, but a decade more if you count building the silliest games imaginable with [Game Maker 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIemLP30i_U) and [WarioWare D.I.Y.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLnQuFiVoew)

After a decade of programming nose-picking games on my Nintendo DS (among other things, like getting a CS degree), I wanted to start sharing my knowledge with others. During the height of COVID-19, I started a 1-on-1 programming tutoring business, aptly named "Coding with Colin." I taught a wide range of students - ages 8 to 68. And I taught a wide range of topics - everything from making a maze game in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), to beginner programming in Python, to recursion in Java, to JSON processing in React.

Teaching gave me a number of immediate benefits (like earning extra money and helping my students grow). But the unexpected long-term benefits have undeniably outweighed the short-term ones.

## Teaching something is the best way to master it

My biggest takeaway from teaching is that teaching a topic is the best way to master it.

Teaching, by its very nature, _forces_ you to know your stuff. If you don't _really_ know something, how are you going to explain it to people who know _nothing_ about it?

Plus, students ask questions. Lots and lots of questions. Usually, they ask follow-up questions that make you explore a topic deeper. But sometimes, they ask questions that take you down paths you never would have gone down on your own. For example, "How can I calculate the largest possible numbers in Python, potentially crashing my computer?"

## An extremely strong knowledge of the fundamentals

As most of my students were beginners at programming, most of my teachings centered around the fundamentals of programming and software engineering. my teachings lead me to truly master the fundamentals of programming. (Which brings me to my next point)

I believe that one if the most important XXXX to long-term success and growth in software engineering is a strong knowledge of the fundamentals.

## Breaking down a problem into small, understandable pieces

When learning to program for the first time, the advice I typically give is "programming isn't about memorizing syntax and typing code; it's about solving problems." But how do we solve problems with programming? How do we get the stupidest thing on Earth, a computer, (essentially, a rock), to solve human-level problems? Before the days of ChatGPT and other Large Language Models, we couldn't just give a computer vague, high-level instructions. Computers don't understand nuance. Computers are rocks. So in order to get a computer to solve a real-world problem, we need to be able to take that large problem, break it down, over and over again, into its smallest possible pieces. "Sub-problems," if you will. Once we have broken a problem down to its simplest logical units (ie, "If X, then do Y," "Take X, and add 3," etc), only then can we tell a computer how to solve the problem.

At the risk of sounding incredibly rude, I'm going to compare the fundamental dumbness of a computer to the naivety of a student. When a student is first starting out with a subject, we cannot expect them to know anything about it, just like we cannot expect computers to derive meaning from high-level instructions. Just like we break down large problems into small problems with code, as teachers, we break down large, unknown concepts into small, digestible lessons.

## A different kind of empathy

A concept that plagues education (especially at the collegiate level) is "the curse of knowledge." When one knows something, it is often difficult to remember what it was like to not know that thing.

As educators, if we carelessly assume that students are aware of the context surrounding a topic, our lessons become meaningless to them. Students cannot even begin to understand what we are telling them. Good educators overcome this by mastering [cognitive empathy](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Routledge_Handbook_of_Philosophy_of/OyodDgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=cognitive%20empathy&pg=PT41&printsec=frontcover): we internalize the perspective our students and anticipate what they do not know. And we can communicate new information in a way that makes sense to beginners, with intentionality.

Along a similar line, as programmers, we need develop a sort of "technological empathy." We need to learn to "think like a computer." As we get better at our craft, we begin to anticipate precisely what data the computer will need in order to solve a problem. And we anticipate how we can "communicate" (code) it in a way that makes sense to both the computer and other engineers.
